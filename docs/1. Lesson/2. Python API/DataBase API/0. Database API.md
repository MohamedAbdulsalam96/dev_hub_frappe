> Document API & Database API are two different ways to interact with data stored in the system.
## 1.	Document API:
* The Document API in Frappe is a high-level abstraction that allows you to work with business entities or "Documents." 
* A document can be considered as an instance of a database record, representing a business object such as a customer, sales order, employee, etc. 
* The Document API provides a set of methods and functions to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) documents. 
* It encapsulates the underlying database operations and provides an object-oriented interface to work with data. 
* The Document API also includes various utility methods for managing workflows, permissions, and validations associated with the documents. 
* It offers an easy and intuitive way to interact with data without directly dealing with database operations.

## 2.	Database API:
* The Database API in Frappe provides interact directly with the database. 
* It allows you to execute raw SQL queries, manage database transactions, and perform operations like inserting, updating, deleting, and querying data at a lower level. 
* The Database API gives you more control and flexibility compared to the Document API. 
* It is useful when you need to perform complex database operations, optimize queries, or work with data in a way that is not directly supported by the Document API.
